# Password-Generator-Using-JavaScript-Alex-Flaherty


## Description
My intention with this project was to create an application for the user to generate themselves a random password based on criteria they have selected. The application runs in the browser and dynamically updates the HTML and CSS using JavaScript code. Each time the user hits the generate password button, a new password based on their criteria is generated and displayed on screen.
The criteria includes the following:

* Password length between 8 and 128 characters.

* Lowercase characters.

* Uppercase characters.

* Numeric Characters.

* Special Characters.

The site is deployed [here.](https://pazoraf.github.io/Password-Generator-Using-JavaScript/)
